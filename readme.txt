My attempt at Curvature

I used the Roberts "Curvature Attributes and their Applications to 3D Interpreted Horizons" paper as
reference for the curvature formulas.

HorizonCurvature.py reads a csv horizon grid and calculates curvature. 


The VolumeCurvature.py reads a seimsic data (in hdf5 format) volume and exports a file of curvature. I just
did Kmean, Kgaus, Kmax for at each sample for now.
